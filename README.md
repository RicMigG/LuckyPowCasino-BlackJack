# Draw, hit, blackjack! LuckyPowCasino!

Introducing **LuckyPowCasino**, a thrilling multiplayer blackjack game developed in two days during the Academia de CÃ³digo programming bootcamp using Java and server sockets. The game invites players to connect through their terminal, offering an *immersive* text-based gaming experience. The primary objective is to reach a hand value of 21 or as close as possible without exceeding it, while also outscoring the dealer. Players must make strategic decisions to hit or stand their cards, keeping in mind the classic blackjack mechanics and rules.

Using **sockets** and **multi-threading**, the game allows multiple clients, as defined by the host during startup, to connect simultaneously and engage in real-time gameplay.

The name of the game is an allusion to the class' nickname "PowRangers", a pun on PowerRangers and the Java method to calculate a given number elevated to the power of another number. ;)
